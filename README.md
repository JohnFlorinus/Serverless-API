# Serverless API

This is a serverless API for Azure Functions with features to make it secure & scalable for production-use.
<br><br>
I built this as a boilerplate for my future personal projects so there are a few design liberties (no interfaces because no unit testing or >2 implementations). Also, everything is referring to <a href="https://batproxy.com">Batproxy</a>, because that is the name of the current project I am working on.

## ðŸ’° Why use Serverless?
Azure Functions offers scale-to-zero billing and top-notch PAYG pricing which means minimal cloud expenses both for small and high workloads compared to traditional API deployment such as App Service, Container Apps and VMs. With great built-in scaling it is also great for businesses that value their money and scalability.
<br><br>
With the free quota on the consumption plan, you can run your api 24/7 for free as long as the monthly api requests stay below 1 million.
Beyond that each million requests costs 0.2$ - so 50 million API requests per month would cost you 10$. There is of course the Duration(GB-s) cost but if you don't do heavy calculations this is also an incredibly small cost.
